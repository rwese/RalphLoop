## Technical Implementation

### Project Structure
```
simple-todo-cli/
├── README.md           # Comprehensive documentation
├── package.json        # NPM package configuration
└── src/
    └── index.js        # Main application (283 lines)
```

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Add tasks with automatic ID generation
- ✅ List all tasks with completion status
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed
- ✅ Remove tasks from the list
- ✅ Persistent JSON storage
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Help command with usage examples
- ✅ Pure Node.js (no external dependencies)

### Key Commands
```bash
# Add a task
node src/index.js add "Buy groceries"

# List all tasks
node src/index.js list

# Mark task as completed
node src/index.js complete 1

# Remove a task
node src/index.js remove 2

# Show help
node src/index.js help
```

---

## Verification Results

### ✅ Build Verification
```bash
✓ Syntax check passed
✓ All commands tested successfully
✓ No build errors or warnings
```

### ✅ Functional Testing
```bash
✓ Help command displays usage information
✓ Add command creates new tasks
✓ List command shows all tasks with status
✓ Complete command marks tasks as done
✓ Remove command deletes tasks
✓ Data persists to JSON file
```

### ✅ Code Quality
- Pure Node.js implementation (no dependencies)
- Proper error handling for all commands
- Clean code structure with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive inline documentation

## Git History

```
fc56e6d feat(examples): Add simple-todo-cli example project
```

**Commit Message:**
- Create a simple Node.js CLI todo application with add, list, complete, and remove commands
- Add persistent JSON storage for todo data
- Include comprehensive README with usage examples and documentation
- Demonstrate autonomous development workflow with RalphLoop
- No external dependencies, pure Node.js implementation

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```bash
# Navigate to the example
cd examples/simple-todo-cli

# Add some tasks
node src/index.js add "Learn Node.js"
node src/index.js add "Build a project"
node src/index.js add "Write documentation"

# List all tasks
node src/index.js list

# Complete the first task
node src/index.js complete 1

# Remove the third task
node src/index.js remove 3

# Show final list
node src/index.js list
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Using only Node.js built-in modules reduces complexity
2. **Clear Structure**: Separating concerns (load, save, add, list, complete, remove) makes code maintainable
3. **Verification First**: Testing each command before committing ensures quality
4. **Documentation**: Clear README reduces support burden

### Patterns to Continue
1. **Verify Before Commit**: Always test functionality before committing
2. **Incremental Development**: Add one feature at a time
3. **Clear Commit Messages**: Descriptive commits help track progress
4. **Update Progress**: Document accomplishments in progress.md

### Potential Improvements
1. **Add Tests**: Implement unit tests for core functionality
2. **Add Linting**: Configure ESLint for code quality
3. **Add TypeScript**: Consider TypeScript for better type safety
4. **Add More Features**: Due dates, priorities, categories

---

## Conclusion

The Simple Todo CLI project successfully demonstrates RalphLoop's ability to autonomously develop simple yet functional command-line applications. All requirements from prompt.md have been met, and the project provides a clean example of the RalphLoop workflow.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Example Project Ready
