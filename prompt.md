# Advanced autonomous development experiment

## Goal

Create a sophisticated Weather Dashboard CLI tool that demonstrates RalphLoop's ability to build command-line applications with external API integration, data processing, and configuration management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Functional CLI Application**: Working command-line tool accessible via terminal
2. **API Integration**: Connects to real weather API service with proper error handling
3. **Data Processing**: Processes and formats weather data in user-friendly ways
4. **Configuration Management**: Supports configuration files and environment variables
5. **Multiple Commands**: Different commands for current weather, forecasts, and location search
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with helpful user messages
7. **Documentation**: Complete README with installation and usage instructions
8. **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality
9. **Package Management**: Published as npm package with proper versioning
10. **Git History**: Show progression of autonomous development through commits
