# Resilience experiment

## Goal

Create a simple Quick Notes web application MVP that demonstrates RalphLoop's autonomous development capabilities. The app should allow users to create, view, edit, and delete short text notes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Functional Web Application**: A working web app accessible via browser
2. **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete notes
3. **Persistent Storage**: Notes persist across browser sessions using localStorage
4. **Clean UI**: Simple, intuitive interface with responsive design
5. **No Build Tools**: Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
6. **Single Page App**: Everything works from one HTML file
7. **Git History**: Show progression of autonomous development through commits
