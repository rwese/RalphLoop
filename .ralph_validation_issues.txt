## Issues Found:
- **Test coverage below 80% requirement**: Current coverage is 34%, requires minimum 80% (per acceptance criterion #13)
- **AGENTS.md not included**: The critical documentation from RalphLoop containing validation workflow requirements is missing (per acceptance criterion #12: "Include all original RalphLoop documentation and examples")
- **No examples from original RalphLoop**: The examples directory does not exist, while acceptance criterion #12 requires including all original RalphLoop examples
- **Git repository has no commits**: The pyRalph git repository exists but has no commits, failing the requirement for "automatic commits with meaningful messages" and proper git history tracking
- **pytest-cov not properly integrated**: Although pytest-cov is listed as a dependency in pyproject.toml, it was not installed and not functioning correctly with pytest

## Recommendations:
1. **Increase test coverage to 80%+**: Write additional unit tests for cli.py, engine.py, git.py, and validation.py modules to reach minimum 80% coverage
2. **Include AGENTS.md**: Copy the AGENTS.md file from /Users/wese/Repos/RalphLoop/AGENTS.md to pyRalph docs/ directory as required by acceptance criterion #12
3. **Add RalphLoop examples**: Copy or create example projects from original RalphLoop (todo-app, book-collection, etc.) to pyRalph examples/ directory
4. **Create initial git commit**: Run `git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit: pyRalph Python implementation"` to establish git history
5. **Install and configure pytest-cov**: Ensure pytest-cov is properly installed and integrated for coverage reporting
