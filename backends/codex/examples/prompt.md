# Code Generation with OpenAI Codex

## Goal

Generate comprehensive REST API endpoints for a task management system using AI-powered code generation.

## Current State

- Empty project structure
- No existing endpoints
- Need to create from scratch

## Requirements

1. Create REST API for task management
2. Implement endpoints:
   - GET /tasks - List all tasks
   - GET /tasks/:id - Get single task
   - POST /tasks - Create new task
   - PUT /tasks/:id - Update task
   - DELETE /tasks/:id - Delete task
3. Add database integration (SQLite for simplicity)
4. Implement authentication middleware
5. Add input validation
6. Write comprehensive unit tests
7. Generate API documentation

## Technical Stack

- Node.js with Express
- SQLite database
- Jest for testing
- Supertest for API testing
- JWT for authentication

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints functional
- [ ] Database operations working
- [ ] Authentication implemented
- [ ] Validation in place
- [ ] Tests passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code follows best practices

## Notes

OpenAI Codex will generate the code based on these requirements. Review all generated code carefully.
