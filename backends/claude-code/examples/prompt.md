# Autonomous Development with Claude Code

## Goal

Implement a new feature for the project using autonomous development with Claude Code integration.

## Current State

- Project is initialized
- Basic structure is in place
- Tests are passing

## Requirements

1. Add new REST API endpoint for user management
2. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
3. Add input validation
4. Write unit tests with >80% coverage
5. Update API documentation
6. Ensure all tests pass

## Success Criteria

- [ ] API endpoint implemented and functional
- [ ] All CRUD operations working
- [ ] Input validation in place
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines

## Technical Requirements

- Use existing project structure
- Follow REST API best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging for debugging
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Notes

Claude Code will analyze the codebase, suggest improvements, and help implement the feature autonomously.
